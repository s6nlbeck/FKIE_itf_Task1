I am writing this as I freeze in my office, in what is supposed to be a \"green\" building. It's boiling outside, but the temperature inside has to be about 21 degrees, maybe less. I have a scarf on at my desk! I've brought it to the attention of my boss several times, but he doesn't seem bothered. Is there such a thing as a fashionable office blanket? Frozen, Central The Dictator rules: In a word, no. While I actually love a cold room, it's important to speak up. Much has been made recently of the gender bias behind low temperatures in male-dominated offices (the cold better suits the faster metabolism of men). But this issue affects not just women, it's the environment, too. Perhaps you need to embarrass your boss in order to effect change?

Democratic Party chairman Martin Lee Chu-ming had tickets for last Friday's game between France and Italy; but he stayed in Hong Kong to meet US President Bill Clinton.\nHe also had tickets for a semi-final, but since it coincided with the first plenary session of the Legislative Council, he missed that, too. After all, he would have handed his opponents a gift on a silver platter if, after all his campaigning for democracy, he was to put sport first.\nBut the final looks safe enough - no Legco meetings on Sunday, no presidential visits, just the chance to meet son Joey, who will fly over from his school in England to join him in the stand at the Stade de France.\nFired up by 'First Lady' zeal following the presidential visit, Mrs Chief Executive Betty Tung Chiu Hung-ping has decided perhaps she too should lead a crusade on a similar theme to the high-profile 'Say No To Drugs' campaign of former US president Ronald Reagan's wife Nancy.\nBut what could it be?
