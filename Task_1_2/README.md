# Subtask 2

**Note: This task is quite similar to the first, so the documentation is quite short. have a look on the description aif task 1.**



## Training

First we need to transform the sentences to suitable embeddings. Use the ```generate_sentence_embeddings``` method for that.
Then as usual use the fit function. An example how the training works is given in the main method.

## Predicting

Use as usual the ```predict``` function.

To reproduce the results form the paper, use the ```generate_submissons_all_steps```
function.
